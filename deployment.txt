Deployment: procedure.
Some paths must be adapted depending on the environment.

the config.php is creating a "LOCATOR" global constant that is containing the path to the base folder of the game.

If the game is not put in the root folder of the server, you must add the path after the '$_SERVER ['DOCUMENT_ROOT']'
e.g.:
define('LOCATOR', $_SERVER ['DOCUMENT_ROOT']. '/game');

the files "controller/controllerconfig.php" and "dal/class.MySQLConnector.php" must be edited in the same way.
They refere to the config.php
e.g.:
require_once ($_SERVER ['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/game/config.php');
